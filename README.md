"#Chain-Reaction"
A strategy game for 2 players.
The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.

Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player. A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour. As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are out of the game.

Each corner has a capacity of maximum 1 orb, edge has 2 orbs, and rest have max 3 orbs. Any more and the block (tile) explodes, and gives 1 orb in each direction.
